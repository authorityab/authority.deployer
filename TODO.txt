* Maybe use socket.io Acknowledgements instead of specific return emits. // Semi-done...

* Figure out what to do after a deploy has succeeded/failed.

* New design

* Figure out how to put left/right methods in main again

* If triggerDeploy return taskId === null, figure out what to do

* Maybe split up dashboard and project deployment

* Do the TC build polling on windows server side instead
